/**
 * DERIVED INTELLIGENCE — the summaries, computed instead of remembered
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * Six products used to live as rows in tables nothing ever wrote:
 *
 *   accountability_summary · collaboration_scores · collaboration_summary
 *   predictive_risk_scores · executive_memory_items · intelligence_results
 *
 * Every one was seeded once by SQL and read forever after as though current.
 * This module computes all six on demand, so the numbers a user sees are
 * answers to the database's present state rather than a memory of its past.
 *
 * ── The rule that shapes this file ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * COMPUTE FROM ROOTS, NEVER FROM ANOTHER DERIVED TABLE.
 *
 * The database contains a second tier of tables that also look like inputs —
 * `governance_assessments`, `continuity_assessments`, `failure_patterns`,
 * `incident_patterns`, `hero_dependencies`, `accountability_scores` — and every
 * one of them is itself computed-and-never-refreshed. Deriving a summary from
 * those would produce something that looks live, recomputes on every request,
 * and is still stale, which is strictly worse than the frozen table it replaced
 * because the staleness would no longer be visible anywhere.
 *
 * So the inputs here are only tables that hold facts somebody or something
 * outside this codebase actually maintains:
 *
 *   employees · agents · owners · workflows · workflow_failures
 *   workflow_runbooks · dependencies · knowledge_assets · tool_users
 *   employee_agent · ai_platforms · tool_policies · policy_violations
 *   tool_ownership · accountability_entities · accountability_links
 *   truth_claims · decision_history
 *
 * `loadRoots()` reads exactly that list and nothing else. If a future analysis
 * needs something not in it, the honest move is to add a root — not to reach
 * for a convenient pre-aggregated table.
 *
 * ── About the formulas ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The seeded rows carried scores with no definition anywhere in the repository:
 * `intelligence_results` claimed GI=62, MI=55, DI=68 against source data whose
 * live averages are nothing like those numbers. Recomputing therefore required
 * DEFINING these measures, not rediscovering them.
 *
 * Every such definition is written out in the comment above the function that
 * implements it, in prose, with its weights named as constants. They are
 * deliberately simple and auditable rather than clever: an executive metric
 * whose derivation cannot be explained in a paragraph is not worth the trust
 * placed in it. Expect to tune the weights — that is a product conversation,
 * and this file is written so it can happen in one place.
 *
 * ── Provenance ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every function returns `computedAt`, `source: 'live'` and an `inputs` map of
 * which root tables it read and how many rows each contributed. Callers should
 * pass that through to the client. The point is not decoration: it is that a
 * consumer can tell a computed answer from a remembered one without knowing
 * anything about this file.

 * ai_tools_used, ai_agents_used, critical_agents_owned, has_backup — so the
 * counting is recovered rather than invented. The three SCORES are definitions:
 *
 *   ADOPTION (0-100). How much AI this person actually works with, weighted by
 *   how heavily they use it. A platform used at `power` level counts for more
 *   than one touched `rare`ly, because a rarely-touched licence is a cost line,
 *   not adoption. Agents count double: being assigned to an agent is a working
 *   relationship, not a login.
 *
 *   DEPENDENCY (0-100). How badly the ORGANIZATION depends on this one person.
 *   This is a risk measure, not a compliment: it rises with each critical asset
 *   they own and jumps when nobody is named as their backup. A high dependency
 *   score is a continuity problem, and the person is usually its victim.
 *
 *   COLLABORATION (0-100). Adoption is good, concentration is not, so this
 *   blends high adoption with LOW dependency. Someone who uses everything and
 *   is also the only one who can is not collaborating — they are a bottleneck.
 *

/**
 * Replaces the 15 `predictive_risk_scores` rows.

 * the {name -> points} shape are kept from the frozen table's
 * `contributing_factors` JSON so existing consumers keep working.
 *
 * The factors, and why each is weighted where it is:
 *
 *   single_owner (30)          one named owner, no backup. The largest single
 *                              factor because it is the only one where the
 *                              organization loses the asset outright.
 *   high_dependency_count (25) three or more things break with it (12 for one
 *                              or two). Blast radius, not fragility.
 *   critical_workflow (27)     a workflow rated high or critical depends on it.
 *   undocumented (18)          its knowledge assets are not written down, so
 *                              recovery depends on a person being reachable.
 *   unstable (25/10)           status `failed` / `inactive`. Observed, not
 *                              predicted — an already-failing agent is not a
 *                              risk, it is an incident, and should outrank
 *                              anything merely fragile.
 *   intrinsic_risk (20/12)     the risk level already recorded on the agent.
 *
 * `isEmergingThreat` means the computed score lands in a HIGHER band than the
 * agent's own recorded `risk` label — i.e. the data has moved and the label has
 * not. That makes the flag say something the score alone doesn't, which is the
 * only reason to keep a boolean next to a number.

 * Per-employee aggregate exposure across everything they own (agents,

 * tier-count sum), neither grounded in anything. This reuses RISK_FACTORS'
 * existing scale instead of inventing new numbers, and threatLevel()'s
 * existing 35/55/75 bands instead of a third tier scheme (the frontend used
 * 50/25/10).
 *
 * agentRisk (mean of predictiveRisk()'s real predictedScore over owned
 * agents) is the dominant term. Workflow backup coverage is deliberately
 * NOT counted as its own factor: a workflow's backup_owner is resolved from
 * its owner's OWN backup_owner row (see routes/workflows/index.js), the same
 * fact predictiveRisk()'s SINGLE_OWNER factor for their agents already
 * prices in -- counting it twice would double-weight one signal, not add a
 * second one. Critical-workflow load and tool-backup coverage ARE
 * independent real facts, so they contribute as a fraction of owned
 * workflows/tools (not a raw count, so one person having many workflows
 * doesn't mechanically inflate the score) times the matching existing
 * RISK_FACTORS weight.
 *
 * Roots: employees, agents, workflows, workflow_runbooks, ai_platforms,

 *
 * D-60 (owner decision, 2026-08-26): `routes/memory/memory.js` already had its
 * own same-named `computeMemoryStatus()`/IMHS -- but a DIFFERENT formula (undocumented
 * + high/critical criticality, ignoring backup_owner entirely) that nothing
 * actually consumed for data (only a health pinger touched `/health`; `/map`
 * and `/employee/:name` had zero callers). The owner picked the frontend's

 * this module's own "memory carrier" framing (would this survive the owner
 * leaving?) rather than a general risk-exposure question mislabeled as
 * memory status. Ported verbatim: same 4-status rules, same carrier-tier
 * weights (undocumented*2 + noBackup), same IMHS weights (1.0/0.5/0.25/0).
 *

 *     (silently defaults unassessed to 'low' -- a separate, already-flagged
 *     issue this doesn't fix, just doesn't propagate into new code).
 *   - "documented" for agents/tools is a conjunction across every matching
 *     knowledge_assets row (one undocumented row means not fully documented),
 *     matching tools.js's own fix for the same "last write wins" bug class
 *     (F-K) rather than routes/agents.js's older order-dependent version.

 * The other four analyses in this file recover a definition that the data or
 * the column names already implied. These three do not. The seeded rows
 * asserted GI=62, MI=55, DI=68 with no derivation recorded anywhere in the
 * repository, and none of the three matches any aggregate of the live source
 * tables (live governance averages 46, continuity 50, documentation 48).
 *
 * So the definitions below are AUTHORED, not recovered. They are a considered
 * proposal, not a restoration of intent:
 *
 *   GI — Governance Intelligence. Are the rules written down and followed?
 *        Equal thirds: runbook coverage (documented / all workflows), policy
 *        coverage (platforms under an active policy / all platforms), and a
 *        violation penalty (100 minus weighted open violations).
 *
 *   MI — Management Intelligence. Is it clear who answers for what?
 *        Equal thirds: the accountability score above, backup coverage (named
 *        owners with a backup / all named owners), and ownership coverage
 *        (knowledge assets with an owner / all knowledge assets).
 *
 *   DI — Data Intelligence. Can the organization trust what it knows?
 *        Equal thirds: documentation coverage (documented / all knowledge
 *        assets), verification rate (VERIFIED / all truth claims), and a
 *        contradiction penalty (100 minus the contradicted share, tripled,
 *        because a contradicted claim is far worse than a merely unverified
 *        one — it means two parts of the organization disagree on a fact).
 *
 *   org_score — weighted mean, GOVERNANCE 0.35 / MANAGEMENT 0.35 / DATA 0.30.
 *        Data is weighted slightly lower only because its inputs are the
 *        thinnest; raise it once truth_claims covers more of the estate.
 *
 * Each pillar returns its components, so a reader can see which third dragged
 * it down rather than being handed a bare number. If these weights are wrong
 * for the business, this is the one place to change them.
