/**
 * CONSTITUTIONAL MODULE IMPLEMENTATIONS (M01–M55) — REAL LOGIC, NO STUBS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Each implementation receives (runtime, context) and returns an intelligence
 * fragment { type, payload, confidence, evidence, recommendations,
 * relationships }. The binder wraps it into a validated Intelligence Package.
 *
 * Every function computes genuine results from the Unified Knowledge Graph
 * (runtime.graph) and, where constitutional, consumes prior modules'
 * intelligence via context.priorIntel.
 *
 * Ownership (of the 23 modules remaining after the 2026-09-02 retirements —
 * see the note below):
 *   Huzaifa  (reality)   — M01 M02 M03 M07 M19 M20 M28 M29 M31 M34 M35
 *   Kamran   (reasoning) — M04 M18 M39 M40
 *   Tahir    (prediction)— M32 M37 M41 M42 M43 M44 M45 M49
 *
 * RESOLVED module-code overlap: until 2026-08-24, M39, M40, M46, M48 and M54
 * below were ALSO independently implemented in
 * backend/routes/intelligence/constitutional.js (via domain/dataset.js's
 * Supabase joins, not this file's knowledge graph) — two real, disagreeing
 * answers to the same catalog code. That file's analyses were renamed off the
 * M-numbers entirely (they compute a related but different question, e.g. its
 * "capability" is a per-department score, M39 here is capability counts), so
 * M01–M55 is now exclusively this file's namespace. See
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-24-brain-as-library-design.md.
 *
 * RETIRED 2026-09-02 (27 modules, catalog 51 → 24): M05, M06, M08, M09, M11,
 * M13, M14, M15, M16, M21, M22, M23, M24, M25, M26, M27, M33, M36, M38, M46,
 * M48, M50, M51, M52, M53, M54, M55. Each was audited against the live SQL /
 * domain/derived.js system already answering the same-sounding question and
 * found redundant with something richer and already shipping — verified by
 * reading both implementations, not just matching names. Two findings from
 * that audit are worth keeping in mind:
 *   - M52/M53 duplicated other BRAIN modules (M19, M18), not just SQL — the
 *     catalog had internal duplication too.
 *   - M46→M48→M55 (Truth gates Advisor, Meta-Brain fuses last) is retired as
 *     a public-facing chain because all three stages already have richer live
 *     answers (truth.js's real claims-verification system, M04's 8-rule
 *     recommendation engine, and TWO existing fusion systems —
 *     orchestrator.js and brainCore.js) — not because verification/advice/
 *     fusion aren't real questions.
 * This is the same retirement M10/M12/M17/M47 already went through on
 * 2026-08-24, for the same reason: the question was already answered live,
 * by something else, better.
 *
 * RETIRED 2026-09-02, LATER THE SAME DAY (1 module, catalog 24 → 23): M30
 * Knowledge Concentration. Found while auditing the other 23 for live
 * wiring — its ownershipConcentration() (analytics.js) was a flat asset
 * count per owner; derived.js's knowledgeConcentration(), already live at
 * GET /api/knowledge/intelligence, is criticality-WEIGHTED and answers the
 * exact same constitutional question ("Where is knowledge dangerously
 * concentrated?") with a strictly richer signal. analytics.js's
 * ownershipConcentration() was deleted with it — no other caller.
 *
 * WIRED UP 2026-09-02: the retirement audit above also checked the other 23
 * modules for a live route, not just for SQL duplication. Five had neither —
 * M28, M29, M31, M34, M35 — and were exposed at
 * routes/intelligence/reality.js. A further seven were found to compute real
 * content their nearest SQL analogue does not: five because they unify
 * MULTIPLE source tables into one graph via graphLoader.js, where the SQL
 * route reads only one (M02 and M03's depends_on-derived rankings cover
 * agent_platform/workflow_tool_dependencies/system_dependencies/
 * system_agent_usage, which GET /api/dependencies and GET /api/risks — both
 * single-table, agent-scoped — do not; M07 exposes governedBy/dependsOn/
 * supports detail per AI agent, including automation agents, which
 * GET /api/tool-intelligence never covers, being ai_platforms/"tools" only;
 * M32 ranks blast radius across every entity type, not just agents, unlike
 * GET /api/dependencies/agent-spofs; M49 mirrors the full graph as one
 * snapshot, which nothing else returns in one call), and two (M01, M20)
 * because the nearest same-named SQL surface answers a structurally
 * different question, not a narrower version of the same one: M01 is
 * asset-first (every asset, owned or not) where GET /api/ownership is
 * owner-first and agent-scoped, so it cannot surface a zero-owner asset;
 * M20 is org-chart reporting structure (reports_to/manages) where
 * GET /api/accountability/* is a RACI system (Responsible/Accountable/
 * Consulted/Informed) — the same word, a different structure, the same
 * distinction API-2 already drew for M39/M40. M01/M02/M03/M07/M20 are in
 * reality.js alongside M28/M29/M31/M34/M35 (same owner/layer); M32/M49 are
 * in prediction.js (Tahir/prediction layer, alongside M37/M41-45).
